## Front end

This application was created using the React framework. I have a moderate amount of experience with React


## Back end

For the backend I used JavaScript and Meteor. I also used MongoDb for my database

## Description of the problem and solution.

A problem I had was writing tests for my components and files because testing is a weak point of mine. To resolve the problem I decided to look up different methods of testing and decided which method of testing was most suitable.
